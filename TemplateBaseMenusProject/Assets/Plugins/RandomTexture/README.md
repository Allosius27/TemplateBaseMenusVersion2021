# RandomTexture

Use this if you want to randomize the texture of any object in your project.

## Getting Started

For a quick import into an existing project, just get the [UnityPackage](RandomTexturePackage.unitypackage).

The RandomTexture folder is an empty project with only the plugin imported and some examples! :)

Create a new RandomTexture data file by going into Assets -> Create -> RandomTexture.

Then you can assign it to a RandomTexture script! (see screenshot below)
